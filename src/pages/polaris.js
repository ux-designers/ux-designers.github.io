              Product recommendations are essential for our customers. They
              guide them through a large product portfolio and are basically the
              foundation of the SAP Transformation Navigator. But how to best
              maintain them? After all, these recommendations can be long, long
              chains of products taking over the functionality of each other.
              How to keep the overview?

          <p>
            What was previously maintained in a large table that only
            specialists could fill in, is now easily accessible in Polaris.
            Product Owners or other people responsible can enter all the info
            needed for their products and add product recommendations. In order
            to help employees with the more difficult recommendations, Polaris
            also includes a product ranking part as well as an area where
            smaller functionality parts are ranked and recommended.

            Product recommendations are maintained on separate cards and need
            some info filled in before being published.
